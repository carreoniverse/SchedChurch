# SchedChurch

 Church is an important place for every religion; this is where we spent time with our family and other people who have the same beliefs. A sacred place where we celebrate many occasions that includes wedding, christening, baptismal, and other religious events to consider. But since there are instances that some people want to celebrate these occasions in a specific church, we will create a system focusing in the reservation of events. The system will be accessible to every person who wants to inquire for the said church.
