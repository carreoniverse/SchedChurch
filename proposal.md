# Project Proposal Title

## Project Concept

### Statement of the Problem
 As far as we’ve noticed and observe in our community, not all barangay’s have their own church; because some barangay are small. For that instance people living in places where there are no church tends to go in other places where there are church. Even though they don’t know the schedule of masses and events. And for some people who want to celebrate their special occasions in a specific church, they will go there even though it is far just to ask questions about their inquiries/reservation of their occasion, and that is a little bit costly for them that lead to slow reservation process.

### Proposed Solution
 We will make an app that will fasten up the church event reservation process.

### Target Users
 Every person who go to church.
### Benefits
 It reduces human effort.
